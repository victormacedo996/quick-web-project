# Quick Web Prject

### Background

This project was idealized after I started the web technology curricular unit in the analysis and systems development graduation course. In this curricular unit, the teacher requested the students to create folders and files with the aim of start a HTML and CSS web project for us to train and learn.

As soon as it started to get repetitive, i.e almost every class I had to create new folders and files, I decided to create this simple script to automate this boring task.

### Programing paradigm and language

I chose to use object-oriented programming for being easy to add new features to the program. The choice for using Python is that this language would take less time to develop and this is the language wich I have the most confidence to use in the moment.

### Version control

For version control I decided to use Git, and more precisely Git Flow. With Git Flow I can easily create new branches for each new feature I want to develop, making the version control really under control.
